### Tested:
- Posts endpoint
- Comments endpoint


### Comments:
- Response headers returned correctly
- Response was returned within a reasonable amount of time 
- JSON bodies contained the correct properties in the correct format


### Possible Issues:
- Would like min and max requirements for string length for body, title and name properites for further validation
